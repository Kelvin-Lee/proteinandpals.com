A weight lifting stats board for me and my friends.

## ~~Starting and~~ Viewing the App

~~Once you have the repo on your machine, you can change directories (`cd`) into the repo, and then type and `enter` the following commands:~~
~~- `mongod` (This opens up the database or something like that)~~
~~- `npm start` (This will instruct `npm` to automatically find the entry point into our app).~~

~~The app should then be viewable in your browser by typing in and navigating to `localhost:3000`.~~

Anyone may now view the app at [proteinandpals.com](http://proteinandpals.com) (as long as the server is up and I'm not testing on it). Feel free to leave your own numbers! :muscle:

## Notes
- The original codebase of this repository was basically a fork of my `thinkster` repository, which itself closely follows [this tutorial] (https://thinkster.io/mean-stack-tutorial) on how to create a MEAN stack web application. Thus, the original codebase closely resembles the result of that tutorial.

Have fun poking around!
